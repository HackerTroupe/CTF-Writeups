And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the earth.

**Files:** nimrod

**Plan:**  
We are given a ELF 64-bit binary. I guess we are supposed to reverse engineer the binary and find the flag as this is a reversing challenge. 

**Notes:**  
After decompiling the binary and viewing the source code, this looks like it was written in Nim programming language. It asks for flag when we run the binary. After analysing the decompiled source code, this binary uses custom XOR encryption scheme with a keystream generated by a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG). The key components are seed, LCG Formula, Keystream Generation and Encryption. The encrypted flag can be found in .rodata section at offset 0x116f0 containing 34 bytes of encrypted data. Then I implemented a LCG algorithm to generate the same keystream used for encryption, then XOR'ed with the encrypted flag to recover the original text.

**Breakdown:**  
1. Decompiled and Analyzed the binary.
2. It asks for a flag, it has an encrypted flag using custom XOR encryption scheme with a keystream generated by a Linear Congruential Generator (LCG).
3. Implemented the LCG algorithm to generate the same keystream used for encryption, then XORed it with the encrypted flag to recover the original text.

**Outcome:**  
Flag successfully decrypted from the binary

**Flag:**  
`ictf{a_mighty_hunter_bfc16cce9dc8}`
